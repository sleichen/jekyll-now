title: Zillow Zestimate Introduction
---

I started work on the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) [Zillow Prize](https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1) competition. This competition happens in two phases, and Phase 1 is happening now. Phase 2 is only open to the top teams from Phase 1 (which won't be me!). The goal of Phase 1 is to be able to predict the error in the Zillow Zestimate compared to the actual selling price of a property. The Zestimate itself is not part of the data we are given, so the competition is kind of funny in that way, but that's understandable I guess because Zillow doesn't want to make it too easy for people to reverse-engineer their algorithm. I didn't pay too much attention to Phase 2, but I think the basic idea is to make improvements to the Zestimate itself. Like I said though, unless something crazy happens I won't be participating in that phase.

For Phase 1 we have to make Zestimate-error predictions for about 3 million properties in the Los Angeles area. Some of those will be sold in the last three months of this year, and it's those sales that determine the winner of this phase of the competition. A lot of information about each of these properties was given to us. We know things like location, size, number of fireplaces, swimming pools, the year of construction, and about 45 similar things. One tricky thing, though is the fact that a lot of the information is missing! So we have _incomplete_ data in these ~50 categories. Before getting into the statistical modeling, something has to be done about that. I plan to make another post later on where I explain the content of the property data and the steps I take to clean it up.  In the meantime, the code I have so far is on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sleichen/Zillow).
